## Currency [↑](#table-of-contents)

The server uses a virtual currency that we just call money ($)

Money is vital for playing on the server, as it allows you to [[claim land|Claiming]], pay taxes/upkeep, [purchase items from other players](#player-shops-), [[set bounties|Bounties]], and much more...

- **`/balance`** - View your current balance
- **`/baltop`** - View the server's balance leaderboard
- **`/pay`** - Give someone else your money

### How to make money

- Sell items to the [server shop](#server-shop-)
- Claim [[bounties|Bounties]] of other players
- Collect taxes from your Land's members (see [[Claiming]])

## Server shop [↑](#table-of-contents)

The server shop is only used to sell your items to it. You cannot purchase any items, instead, buy from other players via [player shops](#player-shops-)!

To access the server shop, use `/shop`. Select a category and then the **right-click** the block you wish to sell. Use the GUI to complete your transaction!

❗ **You may get more money by using player shops!**

## Player shops [↑](#table-of-contents)

Player shops are similar to the server shop, except, as the name suggests, they're run by other players!

You can only buy items from player shops, if you want to sell your items, you'll need to create your own

To access the player shops GUI, use `/pshop`. From here, you can browse shops/categories/items, view your own shop, and view any of your items that no one bought

### Buying from a shop

1. In the player shops GUI, locate a shop and select it
2. You'll be presented with a list of items being sold with their prices, select the item you want to buy
3. Confirm/deny the purchase

### Creating a shop

1. Hold the item you want to sell
2. Run `/pshop sell [amount] [price]`, by default, it will put 1 item up for sale for $50
3. Your item is now in your shop! You can view your shop by doing `/pshop <your username>`

*To remove an item from your shop, open your shop and right-click on the item you want to remove*
