**Dealing with a nuisance?** Put a bounty on their head with the `/bounty` command and let skilled players track them down to claim your monetary rewards

Located at `/spawn` is a bounty board that can be used to view the current 6 top bounties

You can also track players with bounties by using the command `/bounty track <player>`.                      
Be careful, they’ll see that you’re tracking them when you get close!
